-------------------------------------------------------

Huffman Coding is a suite of packages that work with 
the huffman encoding algorithm to map out, compress,
and decompress files.

Huffman encoding is based on the idea that more
frequently occuring symbols can be represented with 
less than 8 bits to compress the data, and less 
frequently occuring symbols may take more than 8 bits

Huffman encoding works best on files that have a skewed
distribution of bits. It is not as efficient on fairly uniform
data, like wav files or encrypted data

Huffman encoding also places a header infront of the encoded 
data. If the file is small enough, the gained compression
may not be worth the cost of the header

This program comes with 3 executables

huffman_codes :  generates and prints the huffman codes
                 of the symbols from stdin or from a file
                 to stdout or a file

huffman_enocode: compresses data from an infile to stdout 
                 or a file using huffman coding

huffman_decode:  decompress data from stdin or a file 
                 compressed with huffman_encode to 
                 stdout or a file

To install, cd into src/ and
make && sudo make install

BUGS / FUTURE WORK

-allow huffman_encode to read from a stream in
-dynamically reduce the size of the header
-reduce dependance on endianness in decode
-use an output buffer to print when decoding
-perhaps merge into one executable with flags vs 3
